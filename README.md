## Increase Bricktron Cap

"This is not recommended as the game has been balanced (both performance wise and gameplay wise) for a cap of 15 Bricktrons.

However, you can change the cap by going into your Castle Story folder > Info > Lua > Gamemodes > <gamemode of your choice> and open the config.lua file in a text editor. You'll find the BricktronCap value in there."
